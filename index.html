                        implementation of encryption algorithms is a start point
                        for power analysis attacks. Correlation Power Analysis
                        attack is one of power analysis methods that uses
                        correlation between estimated power consumption and
                        real power measurement. This paper uses Correlation
                        Power Analysis attack on a hardware implementation of
                        AES to find embedded secret key. Two power leakage
                        models called Hamming Distance and Switching Glitch
                        is compared for power prediction. It is proven that
                        Switching Glitch model is more efficient than Hamming
                        Distance model in power prediction.</li>

                    In this project the goal was to use IoT solution for sending power consumption data over the
                    network to the servers. For this purpose the device was given to us with a uart interface and a
                    unique communication protocol. My job was to R&D for designing and implementing a IoT solution
                    which gets the power consumption data via uart interface and send it through LTE module using

<ul><li>In this project I implemented a cache module in vhdl. On top of the cache two extra module were
implemented including Compressor and Decompressor. In case of write operation to cache:Compressor module get the data from UART interface and compress the data and send it to cache.
Cache stores the data and when a read operation happens Decompressor module reads the
compressed data and decompress it and send it over uart module. Entire project were implemented
in VHDL.</li></ul>
